# TriviaGame

This Game is just one that I managed to do in a few short days. Utilizing Javascript, HTML, CSS, and JSON. I've fetched the material from an API using a JSON method. The API came from jservice.io. The goal of this game is to answer as many trivia questions as you can. *Hint you only get 10* Start the Game by hitting the "Start Game" button and see if you have what it takes.
